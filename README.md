### Business Problem

Conducting comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on shopping data to identify trends, extract actionable insights, and develop data visualizations. These insights equip businesses with valuable information related to consumer shopping behavior, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and enhance operational strategies

### Insights and Recommendations

* There is a significant gender imbalance, with males representing roughly twice the number of females
* Clothing dominates sales distribution, indicating strong customer interest. It is a key area for increasing promotions, inventory, and enhancing customer             experience
* Payment methods are fairly balanced, with PayPal (17.4%) being slightly preferred over others like bank transfers and credit cards. While PayPal leads slightly,      traditional methods like credit cards and cash remain strong
* Sneakers, shoes, and coats show consistent performance, with tight interquartile ranges (IQRs) in customer reviews
* Develop targeted offers, discounts, or loyalty programs to encourage non-subscribers to opt for a subscription
* Continue to focus on the clothing and footwear categories, as they have strong customer interest and satisfaction. Explore promotions or new product lines to         maximize demand in these areas
* Focus on improving customer satisfaction for items like sandals and blouses, which have shown lower ratings, by addressing quality concerns or offering better value
* Ensure a broad range of payment methods, including digital and traditional options, to cater to the diverse preferences of the customer base. Offering a wide range   of payment options could increase customer satisfaction.
* Target high-spending regions like Montana, California, and Illinois with premium offers, while exploring ways to increase engagement in lower-spending regions like   Kansas and Florida through pricing strategies, offers and discounts
* Implement strategies to boost the sales of smaller segments like footwear and outerwear, such as seasonal promotions or expanding the product range
* A large proportion (73%) of the dataset has not opted for a subscription, while only 27% have subscribed. This highlights a need to improve subscription rates
